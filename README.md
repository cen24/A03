**GIT TUTORIAL**

#GitHub Flow
This is a branch based workflow built around the git commands described above and other commands as well which are used by teams and people around the globe. Branch based meaning each team member can create a local copy of the repository on their system to work on and update code and then push it to the Master repository when complete.

**Merge -** Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.

**Merge Conflict -** Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. Git can often resolve differences between branches and merge them automatically.

**Fetch -** This allows you download files and changes from the remote to your local repository. I advise that you always do this before you start working on code or making changes so as to avoid conflicts or working on code your teammate might have already completed

**Remote -** This is the common repository all team members used to exchange their changes. The Remote repository should be most updated version of the code repository. Think of this like a final version after all combined changes by team members. This is where GitHub comes in. The remote version is usually stored on a hosting service like GitHub or a local server.
